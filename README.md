## Add more sounds

1. Add the sound file to the directory `sounds`
2. Open the file `js/sounds.js`
3. Add a new json object with the name and file of the new sound

<code>
    {
        name: "SOUNDNAME", 
        soundFile: "path_to_file"
    },
</code>

4. Make a pull-request
5. If the sound is of another person, that person will be asked to comment wether they are okey with the sound being on the applicaiton
6. Done!
